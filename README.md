# Link-in-Bio static-html-page

Use this template to create a static HTML webpage to share a list of links commonly used in social media profile pages like Instagram. This will allow you to share as many links as you like (linking) to an external page in an unordered list with a description and icons. Each link opens a new tab or window in the browser allowing the viewer to keep the Link-in-Bio webpage available to view other links. You can host your webpage on Render.com or a custom domain.
